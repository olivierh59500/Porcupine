{"name":"Porcupine","tagline":"Linux software to prevent unauthorized physical access to your machine.","body":"# Porcupine:\r\n\r\nSoftware to prevent unauthorized physical access to your machine.<br>\r\nIt listens for udev events and could take 3 different actions when certain storage devices are detected:<br>\r\n  1. Defense (Reboot PC)<br>\r\n  2. Freeze PC (Launch a fork bomb to freeze PC and fill all RAM in short time)<br>\r\n  2. Offense (If it's a USB drive, it'll be overwritten, if it's a CD/DVD ROM it'll be eject)<br>\r\n  3. Offense + Defense (The previus modes, combined)<br>\r\n  4. Learning (Learning mode to populate trusted devices list)\r\n\r\nThe software is composed also by a \"Emergency Wipe List\": when an action like defense or offense is erased,<br>\r\nporcupine will also wipe the file in this list through secure-delete software by THC<br>\r\n\r\nI suggest you (it's quite a must...) to use Full Disk Encryption in order to obtain the best results<br>\r\n(e.g. What happens if someone try to stick his USB pendrive in your PC? In defensive mode, the PC will reboot and<br> \r\nthe intruder will be redirected to FDE password prompt)<br>\r\n\r\nThis program is created with int0x80 talk \"Anti-Forensic for the Louise\" from Derbycon 2012 in mind.<br>\r\nFor every reference about the original concept by int0x80 please look at:<br>\r\n- GitHub  - https://github.com/int0x80/anti-forensics<br>\r\n- Youtube - \"Anti-Forensic for the Louise\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HK1JHR7LIM<br>\r\n- Youtube - \"Moar Anti-Forensic for the Louise\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3nLrJrkYOc<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requirements:\r\n\r\n**Must:**<br>\r\n- A PC with a Linux distribution installed (preferred: Ubuntu, Mint)<br>\r\n- Python interpreter, pyudev library and wxwidget bindings for python.<br>\r\n  - python >= 2.7<br>\r\n  - python-wxgtk2.8 >= 2.8.12.1<br>\r\n  - pyudev >= 0.16.1<br>\r\n  - secure-delete (this is the name on ubuntu repos, check for your own distribution)<br>\r\n    e.g. On Ubuntu 11.04: sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python<br>\r\n         About pyudev >= 0.16.1 on ubuntu systems  look at:<br>\r\n         https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/i386/python-pyudev/0.16.1-1<br>\r\n\r\n**Should:**<br>\r\n- HD with Full Disk Encryption enabled e with a sifficient strong password. This permits to maximize the effets<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage:\r\n\r\n- In main folder add an empty folder called _configs_<br>\r\n- Simply run it with superadmin privileges.<br>\r\n\r\ne.g. To run and detach from console: _sudo nohup ./porcupine.py &_<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n# ToDo:\r\n\r\n- Add MMC/SD/others controls<br>\r\n- Add a checksum system for personal pendrives<br>\r\n- Add the options to run custom actions when device is detected<br>\r\n- Add Shortcut and menu option to hide the trayicon (partially implemented. At the moment<br>\r\n  only hide is possible, no resume from hide)<br>\r\n- Password protect Quit action (maybe)<br>\r\n- Password protect Settings menu (maybe)<br>\r\n- Password protect Stop action (maybe)<br>\r\n- Password protect Show trayicon action (maybe)<br>\r\n- More Tests<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Known bugs:\r\n\r\n- None from the last tests, but please help me to improve the software. More testers are better than me alone!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
